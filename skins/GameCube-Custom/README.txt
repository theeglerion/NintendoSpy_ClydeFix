StarkNebula's Custom GameCube Skins

This format hopefully serves you better:

* By having controller images as PNGs with alpha, you can add your own BG colour
  to key out with OBS's WindowCapture feature (using any image editor, really, even some
  online editors would work great -- packed in "ColourKeyScreens" are various colours to
  open up and place beneath the controller image.) This means you can add your own fancy
  BG images too!
  
* PSDs are open source and zipped up neatly next to the other files in this directory.
  Make your own spiffy looking colour variations and decals to customize to your delight!
  PSDs are presented as-is. I'm sorry they ended up pretty messy, but hey, it's free.

* Using separate folders for buttons and controllers just makes things manageable.

* For the minimalist/hardcore, you can make simple, flat looking controllers with no eye-
  candy to make the inputs stand out more, as well as colourize buttons (AKA make them
  red or magenta to really stand out.)
  
  Happy Streaming!
